Files in directory:
1. csf-biomarker-match.py: Python script that matches the Patient ID (PTID) and Diagnosis (Screen.Diagnosis) to the CSF Tau and A-Beta values. This is done by adding the two columns to the original csv file that tracks the two biomarkers. 
2. output.csv - output after running the script on the above file

Additional Files needed:
- 1.5T and 3.0T Standardized Lists (has been uploaded to ROSIE)
